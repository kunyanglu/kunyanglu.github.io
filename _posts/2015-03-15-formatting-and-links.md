I’m not a fan of the concept of derterminism because I embrace a passionate conviction in free fill.

Just quickly googling the term, I found the following definition offered in courtesy of Oxford Languages:<br>

#### Determinism:
<ul>
     the doctrine that all events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will.
</ul>

My position on this worldview is absolute —

<blockquote>
    Determinism converys passivity, not transcedence; it downgrades the volition of human beings — a cogitive capacity most remarkably developed in homo sapiens, indispensable for the existence of virtues, and crucial for our moral judgments; it diminishes us, people who make relentless efforts in pursuing our own happiness, to a group of dummies, making unavailing sways that are inescapable to the grip of some puppet manipulator out of the reach.
</blockquote>

“God does not play dice with the universe”, a phrase from Albert Einstein that I’m sure most of us are familiar with. Einstein accepts the mathematical laws (I would like to undertsand his reference to ‘God’ as a metaphor of the natural laws) that govern the formation and transformation of the universe as objective realities that should be taken for granted — in simplier terms, *existence exists*.

**But his words have been wrongly assumed for promoting the view of determinism.**

It seems to many people that determinism provides theoretical foundation for scientific endeavors. The mission of science is to uncover the natural laws that determine the universe, but before embarking on the journey of making discoveries, we first need to agree that the objective realities can be discovered — that is, *existence exists, and we can know it*.

First of all, that *existence exists* and that *we can know it* are two axioms which I endorse wholeheartedly. However, I don’t think these two axioms lead to the conclusion of determinism. Let me illustrate.

That *existence exists* and *we can know it* means we can discover hidden principles that can relate causes to corresponding effects or find association among variables. Free will is the freedom of controlling our mind to make decisions, so the existence of independent decision making serves to falsify determinism. **That we can uncover and study the natural laws of the universe by no means has the possibility of inhibiting the process of independent decision making.**

The arrival of a rational decision, which is the kind most likely to affect our lives significantly, requires a two-stage process: first, we have to receive external signals from the surrounding environment and then these signals would trigger sensual and perceptual responses; second, we must integrate these low-level, spontaneous responses into a concrete decision that is geared towards certain meaningful purpose — The latter process is much more sophisticated and it is known as *thinking*.

Our mind can be geared towards a purpose of our choice only if we want it. That is, if the human mind were to be metaphorically regarded as a horse — it could meander aimlessly or it could dash for a particular destination — then its rein is in our hands, meaning that we retain the power of choosing to either drift along at its default mode or actively employ it with alertness.

That we can choose to make a choice of drifting or thinking is a fundamental capacity that is unaffected by any pre-determined factors out of our control, which include inborn genetics, prior environment of our upbringing, or some combination of the two. The extent to which we employ our mind is also left to our will: we can choose to think hard, not so hard, or not at all.

<hr>

Because thinking is a voluntary action, decisions — which are obtained from thinking — are also in the control of our mind. Our ability to make choices is powerful. Choice is not an illusion. We have fundamental control over our own mind and we have fundamental control over the path that we aim to take.
