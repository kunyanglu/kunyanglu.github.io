    <h1 class="post-title">What the GAN generates is Not Art</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">August 1, 2021</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The generative adversarial networks–aka. GANs–came to light in 2014. Unlike any conventional architecture of neural networks developed previously, GANs has achieved tremendous success as a deep generative model in learning how the input data are distributed. One of the impressive applications after learning the data distribution is the generation of novel art of a particular style.</p>

<p>However, despite its exceptional performance in generating art-like pieces, a fundamental question still remains–should what the GANs generate deserve an equivalent aesthetic status with art? <strong>The short answer is No</strong>.</p>

<p>Before unfolding my arguments, let’s make sure we share a common understanding of what constitutes a piece of artwork.</p>

<blockquote>
Let’s consider two figures: Figure A is a photograph of the real Mount Olympus, while Figure B is also Mount Olympus, whereas this time with the presence of a few Greek deities (thus certainly not a photograph). Now, which one would you take as Art?
</blockquote>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/not_art.jpg" data-zoomable="" />
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/art.jpg" data-zoomable="" />
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Figure A on the Left. Figure B on the Right.
</div>

<p>I hope it is <a href="https://greekmythology.wikia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus">Figure B</a> instead of <a href="https://pixels.com/featured/mount-olympus-mountain-mount-olympus-howie-garber.html">Figure A</a> that’s in our mind.</p>

<p>The fundamental difference between these two figures is that one involves <strong><em>integration of a concept</em></strong>, while the other does not.</p>

<p>The unique capacity of men is the integration of perceptual materials triggered by external stimuli into concepts by means of abstractions. Concepts have allowed us to deal with knowledge beyond the limitations of our perceptions that are the raw materials of conceptualization. The conceptual understanding of an entity or multiple entities is the <em>source</em> of art.</p>

<blockquote>
  Mount Olympus, which is the highest mountain in Greece, is a concrete existence on Earth, something the ancient Greeks saw and perceived daily; however the Mount Olympus as the residence of the Olympian gods and goddesses under the eyes of Zeus is not. No one climbed up the peak of Mount Olympus and saw the magnificent Olympus temple or had claimed to verify the existence of any of the Twelve Olympians--the Mount Olympus from the ancient Greek mythology is not a perceivable concrete, but a concept that is abstracted from integrating the perceivable characteristics of real Mount Olympus, such as its forbidden altitude and majestic and godly views.
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>The source of art is concepts.</em></strong></p>

<p>The creation of art is concretizing abstract, high-level concepts into tangible and perceivable pieces that reconnect us back to reality. The bridging of an abstraction to a new kind of reality is analogical to the process of translation. But before translating, a concept has to be created in the first place.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Where does a concept come from then?</em></strong></p>

<p>Our arrival at a concept comes from integration–we have to grasp the perceivables, from those raw materials selecting the building blocks of an abstraction that is consistent with our ideal–the function of art is to exhibit an ideal existence.</p>

<p>Take my own artistic taste as an example.</p>

<blockquote>
  I believe humans are heroic beings, who are capable of great virtues--which come by pursuing rational values with an absolutely guiltless heart--who are capable of happiness--which is achieved through objectively recognizing realities, then reshaping them creatively. The greatest virtue is possible if one chooses to commit oneself to relentless self-scrutinization. The most individualized happiness can be acquired if one chooses to achieve the most possible by using what is bestowed by nature to the fullest extent.
  Thus my artistic ideal is the exhibition of the most virtuous and happiest being.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The art I find appreciable is in consistency with my ideal image of human beings. For instance, I would stop by a portrait of a diligent ballet dancer in the Renaissance period who tries to exhaust the strength of her muscles in order to attain the perfect stance. However, I would feel contempt when seeing a painting of a gaut, dishevelled, drifting drug addict in the Anglo-Chinese War.
</blockquote>

<p>The source of art requires integration–a process involves perceiving, selecting, and abstracting, which is only possible through thinking–therefore, art is a concretized cognitive abstraction in nature and it can only be produced by humans–the only species known in reality to exhibit the required cognitive capacity of performing such a task.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>So what is art?</em></strong></p>

<p><em>In a nutshell, it is a reconstruction of realities into a piece expressive of a concept that demonstrates human ideals. Thinking is necessary in this process.</em></p>

<p>This is why we don’t regard the real Mount Olympus in nature as a piece of art, but we may consider a painting of Mount Olympus with the Greek deities as.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>So why is it that what GANs generate is not Art? What are missing out from the generations of GANs?</em></strong></p>

<p><em>The problem is that concepts are either borrowed or completely absent in the pieces produced by GANs</em>.</p>

<p>To understand why, we will need to unveil the particular art-generating mechanisms of this network.</p>

<p>A GAN has two primary components, a <em>discriminator</em> and a <em>generator</em>. The discriminator aims to classify data from the original distribution (i.e. the training samples) from the counterfeits that mimic the true distribution. The generator’s interest is in producing the best counterfeits capable of fooling the discriminator. Through rounds and rounds of adversarial interactions between the discriminator and the generator, the neural network can eventually arrange data–pixels in this scenario–in a way of closely approximating the original distribution of the collection of images used for training.</p>

<p>In other words, the generations of the GANs highly rely on the training data, and those data come from existing creations of previous artists. There is no such thing as an original concept in what the GANs produce–an artistic ideal that determines the layout and values of a bunch of pixels is stolen from real producers.</p>

<p><strong><em>GANs are second-handers</em></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>In general, code driven digital art should not be viewed as art because it is impossible for an original concept to exist–a first-hand concept can only be achieved through human cognition.</strong></p>

<p>This does not mean that artists cannot get inspiration from what’s generated by the GANs–they are free to collect any sensual and perceptual sources as their raw materials for creation. However, the cognitive labor of selecting and integrating from those materials that requires thinking cannot be replaced by a computer–<em>it is just impossible</em>.</p>

<p>To equate the various ways of arranging pixels learned by the GANs that relies on training on pre-existing pieces of original concepts with <em>Art</em>– a resting station that unfolds what is in the dreams of those who are on the most arduous journey of achieving the highest virtues–is a contemptuous depreciation of reason, individuals, and creation. Thus, I deem such a position as <em>unethical</em> in an attempt to defend what I hold as morally invaluable.</p>

<hr />

<p>I know my arguments might be taken as a storm in a teacup–afterall, the GANs generate beautiful visuals and that should be enough for qualifying them as art.</p>

<p>But should they?</p>

<p>Is a drop of liquid with all chemical ingredients found in a drop of tear the equivalent of real tears from those moments of extraordinary grief or happiness? Even if we cannot tell them apart, should we allow a mixture of chemicals and our tears to share the same philosophical grounding? Are human emotions so trivial to us that we feel careless of completely disregarding their existence; that we feel hesitant to even acknowledge their meaningfulness by granting them a slightly different status from the artificials?</p>

<p><strong>I hope we are not.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Beneath my fuss over the GANs lies my manifesto of an ideal existence.</strong></p>
