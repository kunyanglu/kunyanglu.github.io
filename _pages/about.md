## Hi there ￣▽￣

this is Alicia, a junior undergraduate at [**Harvey Mudd College**](https://www.hmc.edu/), double majoring in [**physics**](https://physics.hmc.edu/program/) and a [**joint major in computer science and mathematics**](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/program/csmath-major) with a concentration in philosophy. While trying hard to balance depth and breadth simultaneously, I find myself highly attracted to interdisciplinary subjects, which is why computational neuroscience has become my particular academic interest.

I am currently part of the Laboratory for Inquiring into Valuation and Emotion (LIVE) at Scripps College, where I will work on analyzing EEG and fMRI data using MLE and Bayesian estimation of model parameters.

In the previous two years, I have explored path planning for multi-AUV systems at the [**Lab of Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)**](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/).

I spent another summer at the [**Funke Lab**](https://www.janelia.org/lab/funke-lab) thanks to the [**Janelia Undergraduate Scholar Program**](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/undergraduate-scholars-program) supported by the [**Janelia Research Campus**](https://www.janelia.org/).

Besides science, I enjoy a wide variety of sports--tennis (glorifying past as a varsity single player now accelerating downhill and easily beatable by my little brother), badminton, table tennis, boxing, yoga (with mom). Outside of sports, I squander my leisure on reading, writing, and thinking about ethics, which is the branch of philosophy that fascinates me the most. I apply ethical theories in uncovering the fundamental issues behind our cultural trends, [***technologies***](https://kunyanglu.github.io/blog/2021/GANs/), and politics.
