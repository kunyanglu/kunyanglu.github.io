#### hi there!

I am a junior undergraduate at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/), double majoring in physics and a joint major in computer science and mathematics with a concentration in philosophy. While trying hard to balance depth and breadth simultaneously, I find myself highly attracted to interdisciplinary subjects, which is why computational neuroscience has become my particular academic interest.

I am currently part of the LIVE lab at Scripps College, where I will work on analyzing EEG and fMRI data using MLE and Bayesian estimation of model parameters.

In the previous two years, I have explored path planning for multi-AUV systems at the [Lab of Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/). You can find out more about our project [here](https://github.com/kunyanglu/hmc-lair-shark-tracking).

I also spent another summer at the [Funke Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/funke-lab) thanks to the [Janelia Undergraduate Scholar Program](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/undergraduate-scholars-program) supported by the [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/).

Besides science, I enjoy a wide variety of sports--tennis (glorifying past as a varsity single player now accelerating downhill and easily beaten by my little brother), badminton, table tennis, boxing, yoga (with mom). Outside of sports, I squander my leisure on reading, writing, and thinking about ethics, which is the branch of philosophy that fascinates me the most. I apply ethical theories in uncovering the fundamental issues behind our cultural trends, technologies, and politics.
